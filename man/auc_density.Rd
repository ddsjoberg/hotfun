\title{Calculate exact AUCs based on the distribution of risk in a population}
\usage{
auc_density(density, cut.points = seq(from = 0, to = 1, by = 0.001), ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{density}{a function name that descirbes the continuous probability density function of the
risk from 0 to 1.}

\item{cut.points}{sequence of points in [0, 1] where the sensitivity and specificity are calculated.
More points lead to a more precise estimate of the AUC.  Default is seq(from = 0, to = 1,by = 0.001).}

\item{...}{arguments for the function specified in density.  For example, dbeta(x, shape1=1, shape2=1)
has need for two additional arguments to specify the density function (shape1 and shape2).}
}
\value{
Returns a list sensitities and specifcities at each cut point, the expected value or
mean risk, and the AUC associated with the distribution.
}
\description{
Provided a distribution of risk in a population, this function calculates the
exact AUC of a model that produces the risk estiamtes.  For example, a logistic
regression model built with a normal linear predictor yields logit-normal distributed
predicted risks.  The AUC from the logisitc regression model is the same as the AUC estimated
from the distribution of the predicted risks, indpendent of the outcome.  This method for AUC
calculation is useful for simulative studies where the predicted risks are a mixture of two
distributions.  The exact prevelance of the outcome can easily be calculated, along with the exact
AUC of the model.
